# Trust Valence Mapper

A visual tool for mapping trust flow in relationship networks. Perfect for coaching sessions, self-reflection, and understanding relationship dynamics.

## Live Demo
🚀 Coming November 16, 2025 (GitHub Pages)

## What It Does
- Visualize up to 8 key relationships
- Score trust bidirectionally (1-3 scale)
- See patterns instantly with color coding
- Save and reload your maps
- Works completely offline

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct Browser
Just open `index.html` in your browser!

### Option 2: Local Server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## How to Use

1. **Add People**: Enter names of people in your relationship network (max 8)
2. **Score Trust**: Click arrows to cycle through trust levels:
   - 🟢 Green (1): High trust - "I'd definitely go to them / they'd come to me"
   - 🟡 Yellow (2): Medium trust - "Maybe, depends on the situation"
   - 🔴 Red (3): Low/No trust - "Unlikely or uncomfortable"
   - ⚪ Gray (0): Not scored yet

3. **Interpret Patterns**:
   - Outward arrows: Your trust in approaching them
   - Inward arrows: Their perceived trust in approaching you
   - Look for asymmetries and red zones

4. **Save Progress**: Use Save/Load buttons to persist your map

## The Questions

**Outward Arrow (You → Them):**
"How confident am I that I would go to this person if I had a problem with them?"

**Inward Arrow (Them → You):**
"How confident am I that this person would come to me if they had a problem with me?"

## Technical Details
