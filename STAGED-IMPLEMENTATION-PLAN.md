# Staged Implementation Plan: True Value Mapper
## From Simple Visualization to Full Coaching Platform

### Overview
Taking the comprehensive ChatGPT spec and breaking it into shippable stages.
Each stage ≤10 complexity points, ships independently, adds value.

---

## Stage 1: Front-End MVP (Week 1 - NOW)
**Ship by:** November 16, 2025
**Complexity:** 10 points
**Value:** Visual proof of concept, user testing

### Features:
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS
- SVG hub-and-spoke visualization
- Add/name up to 8 relationships
- Click arrows to score trust (1-3)
- Color coding (green/yellow/red)
- localStorage persistence
- GitHub Pages deployment

### What Users Can Do:
- Map their relationship network
- Score trust bidirectionally
- See patterns visually
- Save and return to their map

---

## Stage 2: Persistence & Multi-Map (Week 3)
**Complexity:** 10 points
**Value:** Real coaching sessions

### Add:
- Supabase backend (from ChatGPT spec)
- Simple email auth
- Multiple maps per user
- Map naming and timestamps
- Basic CRUD operations

### Keep Simple:
- No templates yet
- No export yet
- Same visualization

---

## Stage 3: Professional Features (Week 4)
**Complexity:** 10 points
**Value:** Coach-ready tool

### Add:
- Export to PNG
- Print-friendly view
- Templates (Family, Work Team)
- Before/after comparisons
- Basic insights panel

### Still Avoiding:
- Complex layouts
- AI features
- Advanced analytics

---

## Stage 4: Enhanced UX (Month 2)
**Complexity:** 10 points
**Value:** Differentiation

### Add:
- Force-directed layout option
- Drag-and-drop positioning
- More scoring options (1-5)
- Accessibility improvements
- Mobile responsive

---

## Stage 5: AI Integration (Month 2-3)
**Complexity:** 10 points
**Value:** Coaching augmentation

### Add (from ChatGPT spec):
- AI session observer
- Suggested questions
- Pattern recognition
- Progress tracking

---

## Future Stages (Post-MVP)
- Multi-model comparison (GPT vs Claude vs Gemini versions)
- Advanced analytics
- Team/organizational maps
- API for integrations
- White-label options

---

## Key Principle
Each stage:
1. Ships independently
2. Provides immediate value
3. Stays ≤10 complexity points
4. Builds on previous stage
5. Can be tested with real users

## Documentation Strategy
- Week 1: Basic README with demo
- Week 2: Product Blueprint (from ChatGPT)
- Week 3: Developer Handoff Guide
- Week 4: Full technical documentation

---

## The Meta-Value
By staging this way, we're literally using the "true value mapper" principle:
- High value/low complexity first
- Ship to learn
- Iterate based on real use
- Avoid infrastructure trap

Each stage maps the value delivered vs complexity invested!
